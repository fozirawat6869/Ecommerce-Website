.stack is not a function, it is just a property of Error objects that shows where the error came from.


âœ… How It Works (Simple Explanation)

CustomError is a child of JavaScript's built-in Error.

super(message) tells the parent Error class what message to use.

this.statusCode lets you attach a custom HTTP status code like 400 or 404.

Error.captureStackTrace(...) gives a cleaner, more accurate error log (optional but useful).
